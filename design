Suffix Array:
	Constructor takes a string and constructs a suffix
    array.
    Second constructor that just takes a suffix tree?

Suffix Tree (Ukkonens algorithm, but mention weiner):
	Constructor that takes a string and constructs
    a suffix tree

	extension: construct tree of multiple strings



Pseudocode:

	1. Construct tree I_1
    2. For i from 1 to m - 1 do
    3. begin phase {i + 1}
    4.     For j from 1 to i + 1
    5.         begin extension j 
    6. 		   find the end of the path labeled S[j..i] in the
    		   current tree. If needed, extend that path by
               adding character S(i + 1), thus assuring that
               string S[j..i + 1] is in the tree
    7. 		end
    8. end

	We will speed up the above algorithm by applying suffix
    links, and speed up tricks 1, 2, and 3.

	Suffix links:
    	For vertex v with path label xw, there is a
        corresponding vertex s(v) with a path label
        that is a prefix of w. 

	Trick 1: edge skipping when the length of alpha
    		 is bigger than the length of an edge. we
             dont need to look at all characters, just
             check the first and length, and skip it.

	Trick 2:

	Trick 3:
